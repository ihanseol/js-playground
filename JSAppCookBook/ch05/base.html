Image Machine dynamically generates JavaScript code and HTML needed to create image rollovers. Here's all you need to get started:

<BR><BR>

<UL>
<LI>the number of image groups
<LI>the width and height in pixels
<LI>the image URLs
<LI>the URLs for the HREF attribute
<LI>optional text messages for the status bar
</UL>

Image Machine then generates cut-and-paste code you can easily drop into your web pages. You can also 
see what the page looks like before you decide to keep the code.
